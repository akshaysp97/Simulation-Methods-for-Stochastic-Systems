# Markov Chain Monte Carlo
In this project we obtain Monte Carlo estimates and variances for various integrals and then implement stratification and importance sampling in our Monte Carlo estimation simulation. We employ Schwefel function to find the global minimum of a 2D surface using simulated annealing. We compare
the behavior of our simulation when using exponential, polynomial, and logarithmic cooling schedules. We then peform simulated annealing simulation to determine a minimal path between 48 state capitals of the US
