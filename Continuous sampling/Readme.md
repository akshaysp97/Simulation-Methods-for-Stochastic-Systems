# Continuous sampling
In this project we employ Box Muller and Polar Marsaglia method to generate samples from normal random variables. We generate samples from a Gamma distribution using an accept-reject method. We perform sampling from an arbitrary alpha-stable distribution to generate samples for different values of alpha and analyze the time series plots for each.
