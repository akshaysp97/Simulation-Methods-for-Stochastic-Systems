# Expectation Maximization
In this project we implement a random number generator for a multivariate Gaussian distribution, for a mixture distribution and for a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) pdf with 2 subpopulations.  We employ the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the pdf parameters of the 2‚ÄêD GMM from samples.
